        <p>
          The United States Department of Commerce and Census Bureau categorize retailers and manufacturers by industry to monitor quarterly and annual revenue.
          The Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses industry includes some of the most prominent retail brands operating without physical brick-and-mortar stores.
          While some of these companies continue to rely on catalogues and telephone hotlines, shifts in consumer habits towards e-commerce has given them additional advantage and avenues for growth in recent decades.

        <h2>Annual Growth in Share of National Retail Revenue</h2>
        <p>
          The Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order House industry grew from representing just over 3% of total annual retail revenue in the U.S. in 1998 to nearly 11% in 2017. 
          The industry also represents over 80% of the country's total e-commerce sales.

        <h2>Shifting Merchandise Share of Industry Sales</h2>
        <p>
          Apparel became the top merchandise category by share in 2005 and represented 16% of industry revenue in 2017.
          Computer and Cell Phones had the greatest share in 2000 with 20% of sales, but its slower relative growth makes it one of the smallest categories today at 3% share.

        <h2>Merchandise Category Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Furniture and Home Furnishings was among the fastest-growing categories in the industry.  Computer Software and Jewelry grew more slowly in comparison.  Apparel's annual increases have been relatively consistent.  The highest growth rate is in the catchall category of Other Merchandise, which the U.S. Census Bureau defines as including "collectibles, souvenirs, auto parts and accessories, hardware, and lawn and garden equipment."
